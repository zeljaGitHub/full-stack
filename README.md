# full-stack

This is an attempt to create a full-stack app with React/Vite + Node.js, aiming to enhance my understanding of the relationship between the frontend and backend. I have successfully connected the two, with the backend API displaying on the frontend, indicating that everything is functioning properly. However, I have not yet been able to upload the project successfully on Netlify.
